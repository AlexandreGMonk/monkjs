In order to use our AI, you will need to authenticate with the flow you like the most.

## Create a new application
* Go on [console.monk.ai](https://console.monk.ai) and register with one workspace like _Google_ or your own credentials
* Verify your email address
* Navigate to the [application section](https://console.monk.ai/application) and click on `CREATE NEW APP`
* Set a name to your app and save

You have now generated an `APPLICATION_ID` and an `APPLICATION_SECRET`

Be sure to never share your secret with a device or someone you don't trust.
