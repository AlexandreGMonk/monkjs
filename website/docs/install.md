We are working to provide as soon as possible new SDKs for other languages.

## JavaScript and React Native

Monk's SDK is made up of different modules which can be dense.
This is why we leave a lot of transparency in the use of the product
and we install the dependencies as peers rather than overloading the modules.

With the following **bulk command**,
you can directly use the SDK for the **JS & React Native stack**.

Install from `npm`
``` npm
npm install @monkvision/corejs @monkvision/react-native @monkvision/react-native-views @reduxjs/toolkit react-native-web --save
```

Install from `yarn`
``` yarn
yarn add @monkvision/corejs @monkvision/react-native @monkvision/react-native-views @reduxjs/toolkit react-native-web
```

The command install all dependencies you need if you go all in. We mean that you probably don't need _react-native-web_ if you don't run your App in the browser.

> Are you starting a new application? We recommend the use of Expo.
> Already have a React Native app? Some may be required
> to manage iOS, Android and Web compatibility as much as possible.
