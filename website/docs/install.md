## Available pre-releases
| Language or framework | Module |
|-----------------------|--------|
| JavaScript | [@monkvision/corejs](#monkvisioncorejs) |
| React Native | [@monkvision/react-native](#monkvisionreact-native)<br/>[@monkvision/react-native-views](#monkvisionreact-native-views) |

We are working to provide as soon as possible new SDKs for _Dart_, _Flutter_ or _Python_.

## JavaScript and React Native

Monk's SDK is made up of different modules which can be dense.
This is why we leave a lot of transparency in the use of the product
and we install the dependencies as peers rather than overloading the modules.

With the following **bulk command**,
you can directly use the SDK for the **JS & React Native stack**.

Install from `npm`
``` npm
npm install @monkvision/corejs @monkvision/react-native @monkvision/react-native-views @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux metro-config babel-preset-expo metro-react-native-babel-preset prop-types react-native-svg react-native-paper --save
```

Install from `yarn`
``` yarn
yarn add @monkvision/corejs @monkvision/react-native @monkvision/react-native-views @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux metro-config babel-preset-expo metro-react-native-babel-preset prop-types react-native-svg react-native-paper
```

> Are you starting a new application? We recommend the use of Expo.
> Already have a React Native app? Some plugins will be required for you
> to manage iOS Android and Web compatibility as much as possible.
